## OpenSRP Reveal
Reveal is a geospatial tool which supports decision makers and intervention managers to guide and track delivery of in-field activities with precision and to hold field teams accountable for action.

Reveal uses smart maps and technology appropriate for low-resource settings to monitor coverage of interventions as they happen. Modeled on the mSpray and DiSARM tool, Reveal helps to optimize available resources and ensure no one is missed in the process. It is an approved Global Good through Digital Square.
